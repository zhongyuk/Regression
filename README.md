# Regression
The practices of developping this repo are...
* Practice building your own regression class.
* Demonstrate performing regression analysis using self-built regression class vs. pandas and scikit-learn
* A comparison and discussion among various regression methods through analysis examples

### About LeastSquare class
* It is assumed that data is imported into workspace by using pandas. Functionalities of LeastSquare is implemented upon numpy. Therefore both explantory variables data chunk and response variable data chunk are both converted into 2D matrix internally before performing computations.
